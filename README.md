# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to segment customers based on their behaviour using K-Means Clustering. The goal is to help businesses identify different customer groups to personalise marketing and improve customer engagement.

---

## 📊 Dataset: Mall_Customers.csv
The dataset includes 200 customer records from a shopping mall with the following attributes:
- **CustomerID**
- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1–100)**

> **Spending Score** is a metric assigned based on customer behaviour and purchasing data.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`
- **Elbow Method** to determine optimal number of clusters
- **K-Means Clustering**
- Visualisation using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Identified **5 distinct customer segments**
- Visualised clusters based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**
- Business can now target:
  - High-income/high-spend customers
  - Low-income/low-spend customers
  - Young high spenders, etc.
